# Beego Test Run
Just a Standard Beego Project with an added Route and Html file. It was my first step after creating a standard web project with the Bee tool. 

## Your First Time using the Beego Framework

This would be a good learning exercise to help you get started with Beego:

1. Make sure Go (golang) is configured on your computer
1. Install Beego on your computer (if not already done)
1. Install the Bee tool on your computer (if not already done)
1. Create a new Beego project somewhere under your $GOPATH using the cli command "bee new beego-test"
1. Start the Beego project with "bee run" at the root level of your project directory (it will hot reload when you save changes to your files) and then watch the site as you make changes. (You will still need to press refresh in your browser to get the new changes you make in the file system). **You can use this project as a reference if you get stuck**
   1. Edit the index.tpl and default.go files to put your own name in the author place
   1. Create another route in the controllers folder like the one that is there. 
   1. (Optionally) Create another .tpl file that you can use as the template file for your new route
   1. Access your new route in your browser
1. See if the changes you made match my changes in this project! 
1. If you get stuck, of course, take a closer look at my Project.
